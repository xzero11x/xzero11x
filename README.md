### 🏛️ Engineering Philosophy
*The quality of a system is measured by its resilience under stress, not by the volume of its code.* I am currently operating in **Deep Work mode**, architecting a proprietary ERP SaaS. This involves rigorous planning and schema design prior to mass-scale implementation.
